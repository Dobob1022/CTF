Turning In

Score : 100

Problem

We recorded another flag... but Steve forgot to tune the radio to the proper frequency. All I hear is some music station. Come on, Steve.

This IQ file was again saved in standard GNURadio format (complex, 32bit float I, 32bit float Q)

This file is IQ format, it's basically capture some radio freq in file. Like pcap files on Wireshark.

I used the SDR (Software Define Radio), and i used SDR# but it's can't not import the IQ file so, it must be changed into wave file.

And I tried to covert this file into wav, using iqToSharp to covert iq file to wav file.

Then import into SDR# with file player plugin.

There is few spot to get signal from noise.

But the spot is not a flag. As you can see there is a small bandwith graph on there, that's the flag.

But! The sound qulity was so suck, I just hear the only "The Flag is". and I can't hear the flag. 

That was so close...
